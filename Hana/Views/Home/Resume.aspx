            Rob Conery</h2>
        <p class="large">
            I have been working with computers for the last 32 years and I have a passion (bordering
            on obsession) for learning as much as I can about programming them. I am proud to
            be considered a thought leader in my industry and I am deeply grateful for the respect
            I've earned from my peers.
        </p>
        <p class="large">
            My focus over the last 4-5 years has centered around giving back what I've learned
            in the form of educational blog posts, screencasts, and the creation of Open Source
            tools. My pride and joy has been <a href="http://subsonicproject.com" target="_blank">
                SubSonic</a>, a data access tool that is focused on simplicity and elegance
            as well as the <a href="/tags/mvc-storefront">MVC Storefront</a>, a 26-part video
            series that shows developers various ways to build a web application using Microsoft
            Tools.
        </p>
        <p class="large">
            My major strength is my ability to communicate concepts both to clients as well
            as other developers - a skill many people equate with project management. I've often
            stated that "I'm not a programmer" as I've identified what I do more in terms of
            art, rather than engineering.

                Thank you so much Rob for putting [the MVC Storefront] out there... I have been
                waiting for this, I have always thought that there are two type of screen casts:
               <br /><br />
               1 - The screen cast from an amateur trying his best to seem like a professional producer
                        (and some pull it off)<br />
               2 - The screen cast that just shows the process, the thoughts, every mistype, error,
                        and idiosyncrasy of the process<br />
               <br /> <br />
                Personally, I like the second screen cast, because in the end, we are all human,
                and we all care about the process because I think we all right bad code and want
                to feel like others do it as well. <br />
